     </div>
     <p>According to the Department of Health and Human Services, a thousand more immigrant children have been separated from their parents under the trump administration than it has been reported. There has been a huge growth in family separations especially in the summer of 2017 prior to the “zero tolerance” policy which was meant to specifically separate immigrant parents from their children if they were caught crossing the border illegally. Despite the fact that the federal judge ordered that the government reunite the parents with their children, the HHS did not keep track of weather or not the children being released were reunited with their families. The border separated more than two thousand children. DHS did not provide HHS with information about the criminal history of the parents and therefore they are not sure why the parents were detained in the first place. As a result, HHS has no information on the children that were released after the judge order and therefore have no idea where these children may be now.
    </p>

     <p>The separation of families is a huge negative psychological effect on the children. Christine from the state of Michigan has fostered 24 migrant children. She had always been concerned about the family separations and so she decided to take on this role. As a foster mom, she has become even more concerned about the mental health and trauma that the children undergo. The children she has had under custody have had lack of sleep, lack of appetite and signs of trauma.

     <p>The U.S has more immigrants than any other country in the world. More than 40 million people living in the U.S were born in another country and they come from almost every country in the world. 76% of immigrants in the U.S are in the country legally. Most immigrants are from mexico, the next largest groups are China, India, the philippines and El salvador. However, asians are projected to become the largest immigrant group in the U.S by 2055. As of recent, more than 1 million immigrants arrive in the U.S each year. If trends continue, immigrants will account for 88% U.S population through 2065. In 2016, the percentage of women giving birth in the past year was higher among immigrants than those who are U.S born. When it comes to refuge, 3 million have come to the U.S. Overall, most immigrants live in California followed by Texas and then New York.

     <p>When it comes to education, Immigrants from Mexico and central america are less likely to be high school graduates than the U.S but immigrants from South and East Asia, Europe, Canada, the middle east and sub-saharan africa were more likely than U.S born residents to have a bachelors or advanced degree. Six in ten U.S citizens say immigrants strengthen the country while 26% say immigrants take jobs, housing and health care. 47% of Americans have positive views on Asians, and 44 on Europeans, but only 26% have positive views of African and Latin American immigrants.

     <p>Alejandro was deported on his way to work on a friday morning forced to leave his wife and two daughters. Alejandro had overstayed his visa and had been considered a fugitive alien according to ICE. He was gone before his oldest daughter began talking, his youngest daughter took her first steps and his third daughter was born. The fear of being targeted is common amongst all immigrants, especially under the current government. President Trump has targeted all 11 million immigrants as priority of deportation. The increase in apprehensions of undocumented immigrants increase primarily of arrests like Alejandro with no prior criminal record. These immigrants being arrested include those who are in the process of filing paperwork for a green card, leaving church or dropping of their children at school. In certain communities immigrants led each other know when they have spotted ICE. Those against immigrants believe its not their fault that immigrants are getting separated from their families or deported.

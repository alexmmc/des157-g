      <b>I am an immigrant</b> is a campaign that celebrates diversity through awareness and storytelling. They encourage all of us to explore our own heritage so that we can connect with one another through our shared experiences. They strongly
      believe that America’s diversity of immigrants make our nation stronger. Through their site they highlight immigrant heritage month every year on the month of June. The celebration of immigrants that they promote on their website has opened
      the door for many immigrants to share their story publicly on the site. They also hold events in which they partner with organizations, churches and even companies across the country that are in support of immigrants. The site also includes
      merch for people to help provide awareness.</p>

    <p>I believe this website provides a powerful voice for immigrants who are often afraid to speak out because they feel scared. Storytelling itself is a powerful way to break down barriers. In this case, there’s a huge barrier beyond just “The
      Wall” between the United States and Mexico. The border that makes the main difference is the critiques, assumptions and ignorance that is put upon immigrants. This is often because many people don’t take the time to hear the powerful stories
      that immigrants live through. Listening to someone story is essential in becoming compassionate so that we try to place ourselves in their shoes and truly understand their position. Without this, we make no progress, remain close minded and
      continue to build walls in a world that belongs to all of us. In order to break down any barrier, there needs to be awareness of what the issue is at hand so that we can take action and make a difference. I believe this campaign does a great
      job at storytelling and creating awareness in a subtle but powerful way.

      <b>Freedom for immigrants</b> is a nonprofit that monitors the human rights abuses that immigrants face when detained by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). The nonprofit provides support through the national hotline and network of
      volunteer detention visitors. They also use storytelling as a form of awareness on their site. One of the projects they highlight are audio postcards to help people on the inside connect with their families on the outside as a way to end their
      isolation and help overcome that barrier. They also use their website as a resource for people who are being detained. This includes not only attorney answered questions but resources on how to find your loved ones since immigrants are very
      often separated from their families. Freedom for immigrants also does a great job in raising awareness about the conditions in the detention center by giving voice to immigrants who have gone through the experience.</p>

    <p>I really enjoy the organization of the website because it provides background beyond their own values, they provide knowledge about what exactly is immigration detention. I think defining terms like these for people who don’t know anything or
      very little about immigration and ICE helps them become knowledgeable about what is going on so that they can then be open to hear of immigrants stories. I also believe this site provides a very creative way of challenging and breaking
      barriers. Storytelling opens the door for understanding and similarities that despite coming from completely different backgrounds, people can still find a connection and most importantly pass on the powerful stories to the generations to
      come. The storytelling the website highlights are done through a variety of forms such as poems, drawings, books, audios, etc. The fact that immigrants themselves are able to tell their story through their choice of medium is a beautiful way
      of using their experience and creativity to raise awareness about what they experience.
